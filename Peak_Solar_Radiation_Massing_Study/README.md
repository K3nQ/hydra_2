### Description 
This file shows how to evaluate peak solar radiation hitting a building massing on the summer design day.  The output allows one to estimate which of a set of massings might require a larger, more expensive HVAC system to produce.  It also can be used to quantify the relative impact of shade on the size/cost of the HVAC system.  
Lastly, the reduction of peak solar (and corresponding cooling load) is often necessary to enable the use of certain low-energy HVAC types, like radiant slabs and chilled beams.
