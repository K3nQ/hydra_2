### Description 
This file shows you how import a Glazing System from LBNL WINDOW to work with the 'Export to THERM' components.  This file represents the original purpose for which THERM was developed.  Namely, to account for window frame geomtries and materials when calculating glazing assembly U-values in LBNL WINDOW.
The glazing system geometry and properties are imported from the 'Detailed' report text file that LBNL WINDOW can output for any glazing system.
To use this file, you wil need to download and install THERM [here](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm/7/index_7_4_3.html)
To generate WINDOW text files of your own, you should have LBNL WINDOW installed from [here](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html).
 Also, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the basics of the THERM export workflow using [this example file](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=THERM_Export_Workflow).
