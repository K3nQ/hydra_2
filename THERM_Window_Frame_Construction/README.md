### Description 
This file shows you how create a basic aluminum frame window construction for THERM.  The file builds the window construction from the base materials and shows how to use the boundary condition component to add Low-E coatings if desired.  This file complements the workflow that builds a window frame construction from an import from LBNL WINDOW, which can be found [here](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=Import_Glazing_System_from_LBNL_WINDOW).
To use this file, you wil need to download and install THERM [here](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm/7/index_7_4_3.html)
 Also, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the basics of the THERM export workflow using [this example file](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=THERM_Export_Workflow).
