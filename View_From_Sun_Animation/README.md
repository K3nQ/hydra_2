### Description 
This file shows how to generate an animation of views from the sun over the course of a day.  Such animations are useful for understanding the times of the day and the year when the sun will be shining on given building elements, like glass facades.  Accordingly, you can anticipate interior glare conditions and the times that the indoor shades will be down.
