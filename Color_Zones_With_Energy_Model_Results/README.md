### Description 
This file shows how to color the zone geometries of a multi-zone energy model with the results of the simulation.
Specifically, the rooms of an unconditioned house are colored with the operative temperature for an extreme hot week of the year in Los Angeles.  By scrolling through the hourly results, one can see that the thermal mass of the house keeps the central living zone more comfortable than the others into the heat of the day.
