### Description 
This file shows you how to create maps of Thermal Comfort Autonomy (TA) from Honeybee energy simulation results.  This includes both tradiational comfort autonomy (the percentage of comfortable hours achieved without heating/cooling), as well as the underheated/overheated hours in different pars of the space (depicted in the Rhino scene for this file).
The spatial maps are made using the results from the thesis of Chris Mackey, which can be found here:

Note that this file takes a long time to compute and requires you to hit each of the boolean toggles outlined in red.
