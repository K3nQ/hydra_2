### Description 
This file will get you familiar with the capabilities of working with weather data in a visual scripting interface like Grasshopper.
This is done through 3 examples:
1) Finding average temperature in a given climate.
2) Calculating the money made by a solar cell in a given climate.
3) Using EPW data to determine the percentage of the year that the outdoor conditions are comfortable.
