### Description 
This file shows how to determine which of a set of building massing design options is better oriented. The study compares the total amount of helpful winter solar radiation (green) with the total amount of harfmul solar radiation (red) to determine a final "radiation benefit" value.  The higher this value, the better performing the building massing is.
