### Description 
This file demonstrates a recommended workflow for creating a complete and accurate full-building energy model with Honeybee.
Starting with zone volumes that are organized according to their program type, this script:
1. assigns custom loads and schedules to each program type.
2. solves adjacency between zones
3. assigns windows
4. creates and assigns constructions
5. assigns an HVAC system
6. exports the zones and context shade to an EnergyPlus/OpenStudio simulation
5. Calculates EUI from the results
