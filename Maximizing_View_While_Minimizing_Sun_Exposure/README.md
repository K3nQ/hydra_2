### Description 
This file shows how to simultaneously quantify views to the outdoors and annual sun exposure (ASE) in order to design a space with a higher quality of occupant expereince.

By minimizing annual sun exposure, one can ensure that interior blinds/shades do not have to be kept down most of of the time. By balancing this goal with the provision of good visual access to the outdoors, one can ensure that there is still a high quality of expereince for the occupants.
