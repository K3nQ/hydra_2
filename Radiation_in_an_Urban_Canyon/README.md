### Description 
This file shows you how to calculate and visualize radiation in an urban canyon.
Radiation is an important factor in evaluating outdoor thermal comfort as it is typically the biggest driver of thermal diversity across the urban area in the day time.
As such, the average radiation can be used as a proxy for estimating the coolness or warmth of a given micro-climate during the day.
