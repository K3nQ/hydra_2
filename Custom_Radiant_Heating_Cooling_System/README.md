### Description 
This example shows how to customize a radiant heating/cooling system for a Honeybee energy simulation.

It shows both how to customize the radiant surface construction (ie. metal panel radiant, radiant concrete slab) and how to change which surfaces of the zone are thermally active.  This allows one to model radiant ceilings, walls, or whatever is desired.  The results can be used for accurate thermal comfort studies of radiant HVAC systems.
