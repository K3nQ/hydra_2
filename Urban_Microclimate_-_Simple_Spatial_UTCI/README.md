### Description 
This definition shows you how to construct a spatial map of UTCI over an urban area by accounting for direct sun in comfort.

 Importantly, this map of UTCI has the thermal diversity driven only by the presence or absence of direct sun/shade on people.  It does not account for spatial differences in surface temperature across the urban area nor does it account for spatial differences in wind speed.  However, it is useful for illustrating the spatial effect of sun on comfort, which is typically the largest dirver of outdoor comfort during the daytime.

If you would like to account for surface temperature in comfort, it is recommended that you use the Honeybee Microclimate Map workflow as shown here: http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=Outdoor_Microclimate_Map&slide=0&scale=1&offset=0,0
