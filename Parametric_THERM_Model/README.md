### Description 
This example shows how to set up a parametric THERM model with which you can dynamically adjust the thickness of the insulation.

In particular, this file demonstrates that, as insulation thickness increases, it becomes more and more important to account for thermal bridges.  While the steel studs decrease the R-value by a relatively small amount with 1" of insulation, they have a relatively huge effect on the R-value at 12".
