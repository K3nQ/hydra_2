### Description 
This tool displays the impact of glazing geometry and U-value on occupant thermal comfort during winter months. It shows when it is possible to eliminate perimeter heat in cases where the glazing is ratio is small enough and U-Value is low enough to ensure warm interior glass temperature and thermally comfortable occupants.

More specifically, it quantifies thermal discomfort from both overall mean radiant heat loss to the cold glass as well as cold downdraft from the glass, which can cause local discomfort.

This file is a Grasshopper version of a web tool of the same name that has been produced by Payette Architects and can be accessed [here](http://www.payette.com/building-science/glazing-and-winter-comfort-tool).

This Grasshopper version extends the capabilites of the web tool, allowing you to model more geometrically complex cases and insert your own data into the calculation (if you so desire).  This specific grassopper version is meant to accept input parameters in SI units and a seperate file for IP units can be found [here](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=Glazing_and_Winter_Comfort_Tool_-_IP).
