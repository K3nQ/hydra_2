### Description 
This example shows how to apply an [OpenStudio Measure](https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/getting_started/about_measures/) to a model generated with Honeybee.  OpenStudio Measures are small Ruby scripts using the OpenStudio API or the EnergyPlus Input Data Dictionary (IDD) that enable you to apply any feature of EnergyPlus or OpenStudio to your energy model.

This particular example uses a simple measure (included with the download) that allows you to set the fraction of heat that is radiant for lights and equipment (as opposed to convective).

More OpenStudio measures can be downloaded from the NREL [Building Components Liubrary (BCL)](https://bcl.nrel.gov/).

For writing your own measures, see the OpenStudio [Measure Writers Guide](https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/measure_writing_guide/).
