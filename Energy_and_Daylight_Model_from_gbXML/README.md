### Description 
This file shows how to import a gbXML file into Honeybee and use the zones to set up a combination daylight / energy model.
The gbXML file that is used in this example was exported from Revit.  Credit is due to Michal Dengusiak and Theo Armour for developing workflows to clean and check gbXML files with the online [spider](http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r12/gv-app/gv-app.html) platform.
