### Description 
This file illustrates the calculations that are under the hood of the Honeybee microclimate maps.  It breaks down the different parts of the calculation into separate components so that the data from each part of the calculation can be visualized.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This example file is only intended to be a learning resource.  This script is not optimized to build thermal comfort maps for any time period longer than a day or any goemetry larger than a box.

To see the recommended workflow for setting up microclimate maps for anything larger than a box or longer than a day, see [this example](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=Microclimate_Map_-_Simple).
