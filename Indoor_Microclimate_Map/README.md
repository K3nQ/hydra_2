### Description 
This file shows you how to build an indoor microclimate map with both a high spatial and temporal resolution.
The energy model is built with Honeybee components and the microclimate map is constructed from the results of EnergyPlus.
The maps were built as a part of Chris Mackey's Thesis.  Full documentation on this thesis can be found here:
