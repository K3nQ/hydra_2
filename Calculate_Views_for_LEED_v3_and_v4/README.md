### Description 
The LEED v3 views credit requires that 90% of the regularly occupied floor area have a line of sight to the outdoors.  The LEED v4 credit requires that 50% of the floor area have a "quality view" (LEED v4). See the [LEED v4 Website](https://www.usgbc.org/credits/warehouse-and-distribution-centers-existing-buildings/v4/eq122-0) to understand how the USGBC defines a "quality view."

This example shows how to calculate such view criteria including the LEED v3 requirement for 90% of the floor area having a view to the outdoors.

It also shows how to calculate the LEED v4 criteria for a quality view as a view within 3 times the head height of the window and the LEED v4 definition of a quality view as having multiple lines of sight to vision glazing in different directions at least 90 degrees apart.

The inputs to this file are just the opaque building geometry (for LEED v4) the exterior glazing geometry.
