### Description 
This file shows how to set up a THERM model to assess condensation risk in a construction for a space that is humidifed in the winter.
The included Rhino file has a case where condensation will be an issue (the dewpoint happens on the inside of the air barrier) as well as a case where this has been corrected.
To use this file, you wil need to download and install [THERM](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm)
 Also, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the basics of the THERM export workflow using [this example file](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=THERM_Export_Workflow).
