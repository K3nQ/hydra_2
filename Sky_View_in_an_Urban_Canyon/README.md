### Description 
This file shows you how to calculate and visualize sky view for two cases of an urban canyon.
Sky view is an important factor in urban heat island modeling since the inability of warm urban surfaces to radiate heat to a cool night sky is one of the largest contributors to urban heat island.
As such, the average sky view can be used as a proxy for estimating the relative intensity of urban heat island between different cases of urban geometry.
Furthermore, the cloros in the visualization of sky view are correlated to the temperature of the urban surfaces at night.
