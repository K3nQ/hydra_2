### Description 
This file shows you how to calculate and visualize sky view for two cases of an urban canyon.
Sky view is an important factor in urban heat island modeling since one of the primary causes of urban heat island is the ability for warm urban surface to radiate heat back to a cool sky at night.
As such, the average sky view can be used as a proxy for estimating the relative intensity of urban heat island between different cases of urban geometry.
Furthermore, the cloros in the visualization of sky view are correlated to the temperature of the urban surfaces at night.
