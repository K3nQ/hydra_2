### Description 
This file shows you how to estimate the potential for glare in an interior space using the Ladybug "Sunlight Hours" component to visualize the parts of the space exposed to direct sun.
This example produces both a spatial visualization of glare potential over the space as well as a temporal visualization that illustrates when the most glare is happening.
Note that glare, in reality, is a very complex phenomenon that depends upon the view of a particular person expereincing the glare.  Therefore, this file is only meant to give an estimate of glare POTENTIAL and, to understand if an occupant might actually expereince glare in a given point in time, you should be using the Honeybee Image-Based Daylight simulation with the "Glare Analysis" component.
