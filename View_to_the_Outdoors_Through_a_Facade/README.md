### Description 
This file shows you how to quantify the visual connection of a person to the outdoors as a percent of the full 360 field of view.
This type of view analysis is particuarly useful when designing facades and exterior shades to block visually harmful direct sun.  With view analysis, you can ensure that such sun-blocking geometry, which mitigates the pulling of interior blinds, still preserves views to the outdoors when blinds are up.
