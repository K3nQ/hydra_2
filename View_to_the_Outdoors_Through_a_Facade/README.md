### Description 
This file shows how to quantify the visual connection to the outdoors as a percent of the full 360 field of view.

This type of view analysis is particuarly useful when designing facades and exterior shades to block visually harmful direct sun.  With view analysis, you can ensure that such sun-blocking geometry, which mitigates the pulling of interior blinds, still preserves views to the outdoors when blinds are up.

Ultimately, this example helps quantify the floor area that has access to a quality view of the outdoors.  For this file, a quality view is definied as an area with a view factor angle of 20 degrees or greater (or 2% of this full 360 field of view).  This definition is taken from the View Factor Classification 4 presented in [this research paper](http://www.energy.ca.gov/2003publications/CEC-500-2003-082/CEC-500-2003-082-A-09.PDF)
