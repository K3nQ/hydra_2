### Description 
This file shows how to extract the results of EnergyPlus OpenStudio's autosize calculation, which sizes all HVAC esuipment by running the model through a design day. Such sizing calculations are a great way to quanitfy the anticipated savings from strategies like shading on the size + cost of a building's HVAC system.
