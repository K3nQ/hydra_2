### Description 
This file shows you how to use the Honeybee EnergyPlus Window Shade Generator to simultate 3 main types of shading: louvers/venetian blinds, interior roller shades / exterior perforated screens, and switchable glazing (ie. electrochromic glazing).
The main advantages of setting shades with this method in Honeybee (as opposed to using context shading surfaces) is that 1) the surface temperature of the shading elements will be factored into the simulation, 2) you can set dynaimc controls and setpoints for the shading, and 3) it is often faster than simulating several small detailed gometries.
