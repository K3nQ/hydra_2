### Description 
This file shows how to create an EPW file for an Actual Meteorologic Year (AMY) from an existing Typical Meteorologic Year (TMY) EPW file and publicly available data downloaded from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).  This is accomplished by translating all available hourly data from the downloaded NCDC data into the resulting EPW and using the relationship between sky cloud cover and solar radiation in the TMY to approximate AMY solar radiation.

All locations across the plant where hourly publicly available climate data can be downloaded from the NCDC are [shown in this map](https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/hourly)
