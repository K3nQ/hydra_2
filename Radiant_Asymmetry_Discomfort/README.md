### Description 
This file shows how to estimate discomfort from radiant asymmetry using the surface temperature results of an EnergyPlus simulation.

The file contains a component to calculate view factors to the surfaces of the zone as well as a component to estimate the percentage of people dissatisfied from the asymmetry.  For more information on the orgin of this component and the method that it is using see [this discussion](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/radiant-asymmetry-and-mrt?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1502452&xg_source=msg_com_gr_forum).
