### Description
This file shows how to import and visualize a thermal satellite image from the LANDSAT database.  These images are publicly available and can be requested for anywhere on the planet from the Reverb ECHO platform.

[LANDSAT 4-5 images (1984-1013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_5) can be downloaded [here](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search)

At present, this workflow only supports LANDSAT 4-5 data formats.
