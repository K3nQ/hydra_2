### Description 
This file shows how to create a custom schedule that can be written directly into the simulation file (as opposed to into a CSV file, which is the other option supported by Honeybee).
The method used in this file is particularly helpful in relation to weekly-repeating schedules, which can be made much more lighter in terms of file size with this method.  Such schedules can also be easiy portable to other GH files, making it easy to build custom schedule templates for building programs that are not included in Honeybee by default.
