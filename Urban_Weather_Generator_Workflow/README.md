### Description 
This file shows you how to take building geometry from an urban area along with the OpenStudio libraries and warp rural/airport weather data to reflect the climate of the urban area (and its urban heat island). The file automatically assigns ASHRAE construction to the buildings based on the OpenStudio and the climate zone of the EPW weather file. This file includes OpenStudio libraries include defalut templates for 14 building types as well as many different building functions under each of these building types.
