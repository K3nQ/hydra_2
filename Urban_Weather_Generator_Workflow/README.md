### Description 
This file shows how to take building geometry in the form of closed building solids, assign various urban properties, and ultimately warp rural/ airport weather data to reflect the climate of the urban area (and its urban heat island). This is done using the [urban weather generator](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/urbanWeatherGen).
To run this file, you will need to install the Dragonfly plugin by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly/wiki).
