### Description 
This example shows how to set up a test box energy model for 'brute force' parametric simulations.  Specifically, these are simulations where all combinations of a set of sliders are run in order to full map a design space.

This file models a single zone test box of an office and varies the following properties: Glazing Ratio, Window U-Value, Wall R-Value, and HVAC System Type (all air vs. hydronic).  The resulting impact of these properties on zone energy use and HVAC size are recorded using the Colibri components that are distributed with TTToolbox.

The recorded results can be displayed in the design explorer web interface as you see [here](https://goo.gl/1j91iH).

Note: in order to run this file, you need to have TTToolbox installed.  You can download it from Food4Rhino [here](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/tt-toolbox).
