### Description 
This file shows how to model the microclimate around a tree and produce a map of outdoor thermal comfort from the results.
The surface temperature of the ground is computed by using EnergyPlus to model the ground as a zone.
The maps were built as a part of Chris Mackey's Thesis.  Full documentation on this thesis can be found here:
